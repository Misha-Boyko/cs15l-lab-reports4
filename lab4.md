# Lab 4

## The steps I took to edit the file:
The first step I took was to ssh into the lab computer: 
```
ssh cs15lsp23bx@ieng6-201.ucsd.edu
```

I didn't have to type in the password after ssh because I had saved my ssh key onto the machine earlier. Therefore, when I login in from my computer now, the machine recognizes the corresponding key from my laptop and let's me in. I then cloned my fork of the lab7 on github and copy pasted the ssh clone link: 
```
git clone git@github.com:Misha-Boyko/lab7.gitgit@github.com:Misha-Boyko/lab7.git
```

Next I cd into the file I cloned by typing cd l and <tab> to complete the line to cd lab7. The <tab> completes the cd l command to cd lab7.
```
cd l <tab> <enter>
```
I then run the tests to show that it currently fails before any editing of the file.
I type bash te <tab> which auto compeltes to bash test.sh
```
bash te <tab> <enter>
```

The output shows that the tests failed so we need to edit the ListExamples file.
We edit the file by typing vim ListExamples. <tab> which autocompletes to vim ListExamples.java
```
vim ListExamples. <tab> <enter>
```
The vim terminal opens to the top of the page so we write the following commands to fix the error:
```
42 <enter>
e <enter>
r 2 <enter>
```
The terminal opens on the first line so by typing 42 <enter> we are sent to the 43rd line which is the line with the error in it. Then I type e which brings me to the end of the current word which was index1. The r 2 command replaces the "1" in index1 with a 2. The r does the replace and the "2" is what we replace the current character highlighted with.

After correcting the error we type :wq <enter> to save our changes.
```
:wq <enter>
```
To show that these changes fixed the error we run the tests again:
```
bash te <tab> <enter>
```
The "te" autocompletes to test.sh. The bash test.sh runs all of the tests again to show that the tests pass.

Finally now that the changes have been fixed, we add, commit, and push the changes back to our repository:
```
git add . <enter>
git commit -m "Fixed final while loop indexing" <enter>
git push <enter>
```
